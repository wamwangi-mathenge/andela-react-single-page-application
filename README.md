# Single Page Application

When a web page is requested by a browser, the page downloaded includes minimal HTML and JavaScript, and that from then on, there are no more full-page requests made from the browser.

However, being a SPA doesn't mean that there are no server interactions once the browser page downloads. There is almost always server interaction once the full page is downloaded.

This repo demonstrates how to create a Single Page Application by creating a trivial example. This example built follows the same principles that React uses.
